# Austin-Fire-Station
Using QGIS, I created this map to visualize Wildfire Hazard Potential Treatment Areas, Fire Stations, and AFD Fire Incidents (2021-2023, projected for 2025) in Austin, TX. The data was sourced from data.austintexas.gov and processed to highlight areas at risk and key emergency response locations.
